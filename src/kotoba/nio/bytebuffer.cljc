(ns kotoba.nio.bytebuffer
  "A portable byte buffer with java.nio.ByteBuffer semantics — position,
  limit, relative get/put — identical on JVM Clojure and ClojureScript.

  Why this exists: every kotoba-lang library that touches wire bytes needs
  the same trio of operations — read a little-endian u64 from a byte
  sequence, write one back, walk a cursor — and each hand-rolled version
  quietly disagreed with the others. The JVM side reached for
  java.nio.ByteBuffer (JVM-only, and big-endian by default — a real bug
  kotoba-vm's keccak hit), the ClojureScript side reached for DataView,
  and the two had to be kept honest separately. This namespace does it
  once, with NO platform buffer underneath: the backing store is a plain
  vector of ints in [0,255] — the byte shape every kotoba-lang library
  already speaks — behind an atom. The reader conditional survives only
  where the two runtimes genuinely disagree: unsigned 64-bit arithmetic.

  The contract is the java.nio.ByteBuffer one, little-endian:

  - `allocate` / `wrap` produce a buffer at position 0, limit = capacity.
  - relative `get-byte` / `put-byte` / `get-u64` / `put-u64` / `get-bytes`
    / `put-bytes` move position; the `-at` variants take an index and do
    not.
  - a relative read past the limit throws :nio/underflow; a relative write
    that would run past the limit throws :nio/overflow (the
    BufferUnderflowException / BufferOverflowException equivalents).
  - `flip` sets limit = position, position = 0 (the write-then-read turn).

  u64 note: 64-bit values cannot be plain JS numbers, so on :cljs `get-u64`
  returns and `put-u64` accepts a BigInt; on :clj both use plain longs
  (two's-complement bits — the bit pattern is the value). Host code that
  must be platform-agnostic treats the value opaquely and hands it straight
  back (keccak lanes do exactly this).")
